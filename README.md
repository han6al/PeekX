## Overview

PeekX enhances the macOS Quick Look feature by allowing you to preview the contents of any folder without opening it. Simply select a folder in Finder and press Space to see a comprehensive breakdown of its contents, including file types, sizes, and structure.

- **Instant Folder Preview** - View folder contents directly in Quick Look
- **File Statistics** - See total file count, folder size, and file type breakdown
- **Modern Interface** - Clean, native macOS design that matches system aesthetics
- **Lightweight** - Minimal resource usage with fast rendering
- **Sandboxed** - Fully sandboxed for security and privacy
- **Universal Binary** - Supports both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel processor

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `PeekX-X.X.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/altic-dev/PeekX/releases) page
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag PeekX to your Applications folder
4. Launch PeekX once to register the Quick Look extension
5. The app will automatically register and quit

### Option 1B: No Apple Developer Account (Open Source Test Builds)

For unsigned/ad-hoc builds, Quick Look extensions may not auto-register reliably on all systems.  
After copying `PeekX.app` to `/Applications`, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PeekX.app || true
pluginkit -a /Applications/PeekX.app/Contents/PlugIns/PeekXExt.appex
pluginkit -e use -i altic.PeekX.PeekXExt
qlmanage -r cache
killall Finder
```

If you installed from a source checkout, you can use the helper instead:

```bash
/bin/bash ./scripts/post_install_enable.sh /Applications/PeekX.app
```

### Option 1C: Build a Reliable Test DMG (Maintainers)

This project includes a packaging script that builds Release, strips problematic metadata, ad-hoc signs app+extension, and creates a test DMG:

```bash
./scripts/build_test_dmg.sh
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/altic-dev/PeekX.git
cd PeekX

# Open in Xcode and build
open PeekX.xcodeproj
# Build the PeekX scheme (Cmd+B)
```

## Usage

Once installed, using PeekX is straightforward:

1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to any folder
3. Select the folder
4. Press **Space** or click the Quick Look button
5. View instant folder analysis and contents

The Quick Look preview will display:
- Total number of files and subfolders
- Total folder size
- Breakdown by file type
- Large file identification
- Folder structure visualization

## Uninstallation

To remove PeekX:

1. Quit PeekX if running
2. Delete `PeekX.app` from your Applications folder
3. (Optional) Reset Quick Look cache:
   ```bash
   qlmanage -r cache
   killall Finder
   ```

```

### Building

Open the project in Xcode and build the PeekX scheme. The extension will be automatically embedded in the main application bundle.

## Architecture

PeekX consists of two main components:

1. **Main Application (PeekX.app)** - A lightweight background agent that registers the Quick Look extension on launch
2. **Quick Look Extension (PeekXExt.appex)** - The extension that handles folder preview generation

The extension uses native macOS APIs to analyze folder contents and render previews using WebKit for a modern, responsive interface.

## Privacy

PeekX respects your privacy:

- Runs entirely on your Mac with no network access
- Does not collect or transmit any data
- Fully sandboxed with minimal system permissions
- Only accesses folders you explicitly view in Quick Look

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not showing up

If the Quick Look extension doesn't appear after installation:

1. Ensure PeekX.app is in `/Applications`
2. Launch PeekX once to register the extension
3. Register the extension manually:
   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PeekX.app || true
   pluginkit -a /Applications/PeekX.app/Contents/PlugIns/PeekXExt.appex
   pluginkit -e use -i altic.PeekX.PeekXExt
   ```
4. Reset Quick Look cache:
   ```bash
   qlmanage -r cache
   killall Finder
   ```
5. Check extension status:
   ```bash
   pluginkit -m -v -p com.apple.quicklook.preview | grep PeekX
   ```

### Permission issues

If you see permission errors, verify that:
- PeekX has necessary permissions in System Settings
- The app is properly code-signed
- You're running macOS 14.0 or later
